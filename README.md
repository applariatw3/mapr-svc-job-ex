###Example Builder Repo for doing dynamic MAPR Job Builds###

This Repo would be configured as the builder artifact in a build configuration for the MAPR Service Node

The code directory in this repo represents an example for a seperately created code artifact repo or can act as a default set of dynamically built features.

If a code artifact is specified in the appLariat component configuration, the contents of that artifact will overwite the contents of the code directory.
